# 🦄 AkhAI: From Project to Unicorn
## Complete Roadmap for Solo Founder Fundraising

**Author:** Algoq369  
**Date:** December 2025  
**Status:** Pre-Seed / Product Development

## 📊 Executive Summary

**What we're building:** AkhAI - The first AI system that combines multi-model consensus synthesis WITH automatic reasoning methodology selection (CoT/ToT/GTP).

**Market Gap Identified:** 
- Multi-model consensus exists (Genspark, Together AI)
- Intelligent routing exists (Martian, Not Diamond)
- **NOBODY combines both** + methodology auto-selection

**Total Addressable Market:** $48.7B by 2034 (AI orchestration, 23.7% CAGR)

## 💬 Closing Thought

**Genspark reached $50M ARR in 5 months with multi-model consensus.**
**Martian got $9M seed with just routing.**
**Not Diamond got $2.3M seed with routing + prompts.**

**AkhAI combines ALL THREE + methodology selection.**

This is a legitimate market gap. The tech works. The market is hot.
The question isn't IF someone will build this - it's WHO.

**Let's make it us. Let's make AkhAI the next unicorn.**
