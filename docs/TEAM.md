## Core Leadership

### algoq - CEO & Founder
**Combat Sports World Champion | "Vibe Coder" | Performance Visionary**

#### Background
- **Combat Sports:** 10+ years competing at the highest levels of combat sports
- **World Champion:** Achieved world championship title in competitive Combat Sports
- **Business:** Built and scaled multiple businesses in combat sports and wellness industries
- **Philosophy:** Championship discipline + intuitive "vibe coding" approach

#### Why algoq Leads AKHAI
In jiu-jitsu, you learn three critical skills:
1. **Stay calm under pressure** - When your opponent is choking you, you don't panic. You breathe, you think, you execute.
2. **Adapt rapidly** - No plan survives contact with the enemy. You read the situation and pivot instantly.
3. **Commit fully** - Half-measures get you tapped. You commit to the move or you lose.

These same principles apply to building a unicorn. algoq brings:
- **Discipline:** 10+ years of daily training → now daily building
- **Resilience:** Lost matches teach more than victories → failed startups fuel success
- **Intuition:** "Feel" for the right move in combat → "vibe" for the right product decision
- **Long-term vision:** Belt progression takes 10+ years → $100B takes 10+ years

#### Role at AKHAI
- Overall strategic vision (AKHAI Engine → Robot → Cities)
- Product direction and user experience
- Fundraising and investor relations
- Culture and team building (championship mindset)
- Public face of the company (storytelling, brand)

#### Quote
*"In jiu-jitsu, you learn that technique beats strength, and leverage beats force. AKHAI applies this same principle: small, smart teams with the right tech leverage (multi-AI consensus) can outperform massive, inefficient competitors. We're not building by brute force—we're building with precision."*

### Andy - CTO & Co-Founder
**AI Engineering Expert | Technical Architect**

#### Background
- **Expertise:** Deep knowledge of AI systems, multi-agent architectures, and distributed systems
- **Engineering Excellence:** Proven track record of building production-grade AI applications
- **Technical Leadership:** Guides AKHAI's core engine development and architecture decisions

#### Why Andy is Critical
algoq provides the vision and discipline, but Andy provides the **technical legitimacy**. Investors, partners, and enterprise customers need assurance that AKHAI is built on solid engineering foundations—not just hype. Andy delivers that.

- **System Design:** Architected AKHAI's multi-AI consensus engine from scratch
- **Provider Integrations:** Built clean abstractions for Anthropic, DeepSeek, xAI, Mistral
- **GTP Flash:** Designed the parallel processing architecture (3x faster than sequential)
- **Scalability:** Plans for 10,000+ concurrent users, millions of queries per day

#### Role at AKHAI
- Chief Technology Officer (all engineering reports to Andy)
- Lead architect for AKHAI Engine, Robot AI, and City infrastructure
- Hiring and mentoring engineering team
- Technical due diligence for investors
- R&D roadmap (custom models, proprietary algorithms)

#### Quote
*"Multi-AI consensus is not a gimmick—it's a fundamental shift in how AI systems should work. Single models hallucinate, make biased decisions, and lack robustness. By orchestrating multiple AIs, we're building systems that are smarter, safer, and more aligned with human values."*
