# AKHAI Robot - Technical Specifications

**Multi-AI Consensus Embodied in Physical Form**

## Overview

AKHAI Robot brings the power of multi-AI consensus into the physical world through two form factors: a portable handball-sized companion and a full-size humanoid robot. Both share the same core intelligence—AKHAI's proprietary multi-AI consensus engine—but serve different use cases and markets.

**Key Differentiator:** Unlike single-AI robots (Tesla Optimus, Figure 01), AKHAI Robots make decisions through real-time consensus across 4+ AI models, providing more reliable, emotionally intelligent, and contextually aware interactions.
