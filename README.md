*"The future of AI isn't about who has the biggest model—it's about who builds the most trustworthy one."*

## 🎯 The Problem

Today's AI systems share critical flaws:

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Hallucinations** | AI confidently states false information |
| **Black Box Reasoning** | No insight into how conclusions are reached |
| **One-Size-Fits-All** | Same approach for simple questions and complex analysis |
| **Vendor Lock-In** | Dependence on OpenAI/Anthropic APIs |
| **Hype Without Substance** | Exaggerated claims without grounding |

**Result**: Users can't trust AI outputs for serious work.

---

## 💡 The Solution: AkhAI

AkhAI is the **first sovereign AI research engine** that combines 7 reasoning methodologies, real-time grounding verification, and autonomous context intelligence.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 7 Reasoning Methodologies

| Methodology | How It Works | Auto-Triggers On |
|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Direct** | Fast, concise response | Simple factual questions |
| **Chain of Draft (CoD)** | Draft → Reflect → Refine | "step by step", "explain how" |
| **Buffer of Thoughts (BoT)** | Template-based reasoning | Complex context |
| **ReAct** | Thought → Action → Observation | "search", "find latest" |
| **Program of Thought (PoT)** | Code-based computation | Math, calculations |
| **GTP Consensus** | Multi-perspective synthesis | Opinions, decisions |
| **Auto** | Intelligent routing | Any query |

### 🛡️ Grounding Guard

Every response verified through:
- **Hype Detection**: Flags exaggerated claims
- **Echo Detection**: Catches repetitive content
- **Drift Detection**: Monitors topic relevance
- **Factuality Check**: Validates claims

When issues detected, users get:
- **Refine**: AI suggests better questions
- **Continue**: Show response with warning
- **Pivot**: Alternative approaches
