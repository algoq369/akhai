*"The future of AI isn't about who has the biggest model—it's about who builds the most trustworthy one."*

## 🎯 The Problem

Today's AI systems share critical flaws:

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Hallucinations** | AI confidently states false information |
| **Black Box Reasoning** | No insight into how conclusions are reached |
| **One-Size-Fits-All** | Same approach for simple questions and complex analysis |
| **Vendor Lock-In** | Dependence on OpenAI/Anthropic APIs |
| **Hype Without Substance** | Exaggerated claims without grounding |

**Result**: Users can't trust AI outputs for serious work.

---

## 💡 The Solution: AkhAI

AkhAI is the **first sovereign AI research engine** that combines 7 reasoning methodologies, real-time grounding verification, and autonomous context intelligence.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 7 Reasoning Methodologies

| Methodology | How It Works | Auto-Triggers On |
|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Direct** | Fast, concise response | Simple factual questions |
| **Chain of Draft (CoD)** | Draft → Reflect → Refine | "step by step", "explain how" |
| **Buffer of Thoughts (BoT)** | Template-based reasoning | Complex context |
| **ReAct** | Thought → Action → Observation | "search", "find latest" |
| **Program of Thought (PoT)** | Code-based computation | Math, calculations |
| **GTP Consensus** | Multi-perspective synthesis | Opinions, decisions |
| **Auto** | Intelligent routing | Any query |

### 🛡️ Grounding Guard

Every response verified through:
- **Hype Detection**: Flags exaggerated claims
- **Echo Detection**: Catches repetitive content
- **Drift Detection**: Monitors topic relevance
- **Factuality Check**: Validates claims

When issues detected, users get:
- **Refine**: AI suggests better questions
- **Continue**: Show response with warning
- **Pivot**: Alternative approaches

---

## 🚀 Vision & Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Engine ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] 7 reasoning methodologies (direct, cod, bot, react, pot, gtp, auto)
- [x] Grounding Guard (hype, echo, drift, factuality detection)
- [x] Interactive warning system (refine/continue/pivot)
- [x] Real-time data integration (CoinGecko)
- [x] Debug dashboard

### Phase 2: Innovations 🔄 IN PROGRESS
**Session 2: Side Canal** (Current)
- [ ] Topic extraction from conversations
- [ ] Synopsis generation per topic
- [ ] Suggestion engine + alerts
- [ ] Context injection

**Session 3: Mind Map UI**
- [ ] Interactive mind map component
- [ ] Color/pin/archive tools
- [ ] Connection visualization

**Session 4: Legend Mode**
- [ ] Normal/Legend toggle
- [ ] Token tier configuration
- [ ] Premium R&D features

**Session 5: Artifact System**
- [ ] Export (JSON, SVG, Markdown)
- [ ] Research summaries
- [ ] Artifact library

**Session 6: Deploy**
