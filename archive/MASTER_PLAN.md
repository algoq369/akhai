# AKHAI Master Plan — Market-Validated 10-Year Vision

**From AI Engine to Smart Cities: A Disciplined Journey**

**Last Updated:** December 2025  
**Version:** 2.0 (Market-Validated)

---

## Executive Summary

AKHAI is a multi-AI consensus platform evolving into an integrated ecosystem spanning artificial intelligence, robotics, infrastructure, and sovereign communities. Our strategy prioritizes **AI moat first, hardware second** — validated by market research showing consumer robots >$800 have a 100% failure rate.

**The Four Pillars:**
1. **AKHAI Engine** (2025-2026) - Multi-AI consensus research platform
2. **AKHAI Robot** (2027-2028) - Portable & full-size AI embodiment
3. **Server Infrastructure** (2029-2030) - Mining facilities & data centers
4. **BroolyKid Cities** (2030+) - Sovereign smart cities powered by our tech

**Realistic Outcomes:**
- **Base Case:** $1.1B revenue, $6.7B valuation by 2035
- **Optimistic:** $3.5B revenue, $28B valuation by 2035
- **Target:** $10B+ ecosystem

**Current Status:** Phase 3 Complete (v0.3.0) - GTP Flash Architecture Live

## Market Validation (December 2025)

### Key Research Findings

| Finding | Data Point | Source |
|---------|------------|--------|
| Consumer robots >$800 fail | Jibo ($899), Moxie ($799) - BOTH FAILED | IEEE, Market data |
| Humanoid costs dropping | 40% annual decline | Goldman Sachs |
| Humanoid market CAGR | 70% through 2035 | Goldman Sachs |
| AI companion market | $94B by 2034 (24% CAGR) | Market.us |
| Entry humanoid benchmark | Unitree G1 at $13,500 | Current market |

### Strategic Implications

1. **Wait for robot launch (2028 not 2027)** — Costs drop 40%, market matures
2. **Price Portable <€1,000** — Avoid the death zone where every competitor failed
3. **B2B before B2C for Full-Size** — Clear ROI calculations, higher margins
4. **Subscription-first model** — Only path to profitability (Peloton model)
