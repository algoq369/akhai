## Installation Path
All UI components should be installed to:
```
/Users/sheirraza/akhai/packages/web/components/ui/
```

## Design System (Grey-Only)
All components MUST follow the grey-only minimal design system:

**Color Palette:**
- Background: #000000 (black)
- Surface: #111111, #1a1a1a
- Borders: #222222, #333333
- Text Primary: #ffffff (white)
- Text Secondary: #a3a3a3 (gray-400)
- Text Tertiary: #737373 (gray-500)
- Text Muted: #525252 (gray-600)

**Design Patterns:**
- Primary buttons: white bg, black text (inverted)
- Secondary buttons: dark grey bg, light grey text
- NO COLORS - strictly monochrome (no blue, purple, cyan, green, red, yellow)
- Glassmorphism: backdrop-blur with transparency
- Typography hierarchy with size, weight, tracking variations

## Notes
- These are custom implementations inspired by ReactBits concepts
- ReactBits website doesn't provide direct source code download
- All components have been adapted to grey-only minimal design
- Components use framer-motion for animations
