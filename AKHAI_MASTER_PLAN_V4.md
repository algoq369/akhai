## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES (Prioritized)

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY (Pre-Launch Blockers)

#### 1. Production Build Prerender Errors
**Status:** ⚠️ BLOCKING DEPLOYMENT
**Impact:** Cannot create optimized static builds
**Effort:** 4-8 hours
**Solution:** Refactor `useSearchParams()` with proper Suspense boundaries

**Affected Pages:**
- Homepage (`app/page.tsx`)
- Help page (via PostHog provider)
- Idea Factory page

**Workaround Applied:** `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` (forces SSR)

**Next Steps:**
1. Refactor PostHog tracking to Suspense wrapper
2. Test static generation: `npm run build && npm run start`
3. Verify performance improvements (40-60% faster expected)

---

#### 2. Missing Automated Testing
**Status:** ⚠️ TECHNICAL DEBT
**Impact:** Manual testing required, regressions not caught
**Effort:** 2-4 hours setup + ongoing

**Recommendation:**
```bash
pnpm add -D vitest @testing-library/react
```

**Priority Test Coverage:**
1. `lib/anti-qliphoth.ts` - Detection functions
2. `lib/ascent-tracker.ts` - Sefirah calculations
3. `lib/tree-configuration.ts` - Database operations
4. API routes (simple-query, history, tree-config)

**Expected Benefit:** Catch 80%+ of bugs before deployment

---

#### 3. Error Boundary Missing
**Status:** ⚠️ USER EXPERIENCE RISK
**Impact:** Component crashes cause white screen
**Effort:** 3-5 hours

**Solution:** Create global ErrorBoundary + component-level boundaries

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY

#### 4. Tree Config API Verification
**Status:** ⚠️ NEEDS VERIFICATION
**Effort:** 2-3 hours

`TreeConfigurationPanel.tsx` references `/api/tree-config` endpoint - needs verification it exists.

---

#### 5. TypeScript Strict Mode
**Status:** 💡 IMPROVEMENT
**Effort:** 8-12 hours

Current codebase uses type assertions (`as`). Recommend enabling strict mode and fixing all implicit `any` types.

---

### 🟢 LOW PRIORITY (Post-Launch Optimizations)

6. API Response Caching (6-8 hours) - 70%+ cache hit rate potential
7. Code Splitting & Lazy Loading (8-12 hours) - 30-50% faster initial load
8. WebSocket Real-time Updates (12-16 hours) - Live query progress

**See:** `ENHANCEMENT_ISSUES_LIST.md` for complete details
